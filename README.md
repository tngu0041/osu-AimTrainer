# osu Aim Trainer Mods
Maybe you like osu. <br>
Maybe you like FPS Aim Trainers. <br>
Well here's what nobody asked for: Custom mods for osu Standard, inspired by FPS Aim Trainers.

### Tracking Ricochet
Hit objects move in random directions and rebound if they hit the edges of the playfield. Speed can be customized. Random (seed) option is available.

### Build Release:
Soon (maybe).
This is still in development, with bugs to fix, and more mods planned (air movement, popcorn/bouncing, etc).
For now, if you want to try these custom mods, you will need to manually build the project for development. For all information on how to build. Please see the [official osu Lazer repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu).

## Bugs
These mods are for fun and are not optimized for playability. Certain gameplay issues are expected:
- *Strafing* mod may have hit objects that go off-screen. The extent will depend on the Speed and Frequency parameters, as well as your screen resolution. If using wide resolutions (like an ultrawide 21:9 resolution) this will be less prominent. May be fixed in the future with custom options to keep hit objects within playfield bounds.
- *Tracking Ricochet* mod can have unhittable sliders if the slider body or slider ends drift off screen.

If you encounter any game-breaking bugs (like crashes), feel free to report. Please include steps to reproduce (i.e. the beatmap and difficulty and it occurs on, and which mods and custom options were used).
